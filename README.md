# Dog Gallery üêæ

## Hey There!

Welcome to the Dog Gallery, a fun and simple web app I created to explore the world of asynchronous JavaScript and API integration. This project was born from my curiosity about web development and my love for dogs!

## What's This All About?

The Dog Gallery is a single-page application that showcases beautiful dog images fetched from the Dog API. It's designed to be simple and user-friendly, with easy navigation to browse through dog images.

### Features

- **Dynamic Background:** The animated gradient background, shown above, adds a lively and engaging element to the interface.
- **Simple Navigation:** Browse through dog images with straightforward 'Previous' and 'Next' button controls.
- **Responsive Design:** The gallery is designed to look great on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Interactive Controls:** Easily navigate through the gallery using the 'Previous' and 'Next' buttons to see more dog photos.

## Behind the Scenes

The app uses plain old HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Here's a quick rundown of the tech involved:

- **HTML:** Structures the basic webpage.
- **CSS:** Styles the gallery to make it visually appealing, including dynamic effects like an animated gradient background.
- **JavaScript:** Powers the entire functionality of the app, including API calls to the Dog API using the Fetch API with async/await syntax for seamless asynchronous operations.

## Setup

Want to run this locally? Here's how:

1. Clone this repo to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` in your browser.
3. Enjoy browsing through adorable and funny dog images!

## Thoughts and Reflections

Creating this project was a fantastic learning experience. It allowed me to deepen my understanding of JavaScript's event loop, practice using modern ES6 features, and get more comfortable with API integrations.

Feel free to poke around the code, and maybe even contribute if you see ways to improve it or add new features!
